# CSC 690 - Final Project Spotgram

# Team
Giovanni Rosas-Marin


# Intro
This is an Instagram clone with a custom Parse backend that allows a user to post photos, view a global photos feed, and add comments, chat, has its own little profile still fixed cant be updated.

# What the app will have
I just went with the same Idea of instagram but for cars spotgram added the ability to add pictures, chat with other users, have profile add comments.  Each part took different hours just the chat took 4 hours, putting all the parse together other 4 hours and implementing everything together around 20 plus hours and I still think it would take more time to make it more presentable.
